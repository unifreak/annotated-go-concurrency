# Problem

## Race Condition

A "race condition" occurs when two or more operations must execute in the
correct order, but the program has not been written so that this order is
guaranteed to be maintained.

"Data Race": one process trying to read while another trying to write.

## Atomicity

An operation is "atomic" if it's indivisible, or uninterruptible within a
context. Indivisible or uninterruptible means things happen **in its entirety**.
Context is the scope when we consider what's "entirety", an operation is atomic
in one context does not necessarily mean it still is in another.

Atomicity is important because if something is atomic:

* implicitly it is safe within concurrent contexts. This allows us to compose
  logically correct programs
* it can even serve as a way to optimize concurrent programs.

Consider this statement:

    i++

It's NOT atomic even it seems simple, it actually consist of several operation:

1. Retrieve the value of i.
2. Increment the value of i.
3. Store the value of i to i.

We can force atomicity by employing various techniques. The art then becomes
determining which areas of your code need to be atomic, and at what level of
granularity.

## Memory Access Synchronization, Critical Section

The section of your program that needs exclusive access to a shared resource is
called a "critical section".

## Deadlock

When all concurrent processes are waiting on one another. In this state, the
program will never recover without outside intervention. We call this situation
a "deadlock".

There are a few conditions that must be present for deadlock to happen, known
as "Coffman Conditions":

* Mutual Exclusion: A concurrent process holds exclusive rights to a resource at
  any one time.
* Wait For Condition: A concurrent process must simultaneously hold a resource
  and be waiting for an additional resource.
* No Preemption: A resource held by a concurrent process can only be released by
  that process
* Circular Wait: A concurrent process (P1) must be waiting on a chain of other
  concurrent processes(P2), which are in turn waiting on it (P1)

If we ensure that at least one of these conditions is not true, we can prevent
deadlocks from occurring. Unfortunately, in practice these conditions can be
hard to reason about, and therefore difficult to prevent.

## Livelock

"Livelock" means both actively performing concurrent operation, but these
operation do nothing to move the state of program foward. (two people in
hallway).

Livelock is subset of problem "starvation", except they starve *equally*.

A common reason for livelock is: two or more concurrent processes attempting to
prevent a deadlock without coordination.

## Starvation

Starvation means concurrent process cannot get all the resources it needs to
perform work. Comparing to livelock, which starved equally, more broadly,
starvation usually implies that there are one or more greedy concurrent process
that are unfaily preventing others from accomplishing works.

A technique for identifying the starvation is by using a metric. Starvation
makes for a good argument for recording and sampling metrics. One of the ways
you can detect and solve starvation is by logging when work is accomplished,
and then determining if your rate of work is as high as you expect it.

Starvation can cause not only inefficiency, it can also completely pervent
another process from accomplishing work.

Any resource must be shared is a candidate for starvation: cpu, mem, file, db,
net...

If you utilize memory access synchronization, you’ll have to find a balance
between preferring coarse-grained synchronization for performance, and
fine-grained synchronization for fairness. When it comes time to performance
tune your application, to start with, I highly recommend you constrain memory
access synchronization only to critical sections; if the synchronization
becomes a performance problem, you can always broaden the scope. It’s much
**harder to go the other way**.

## Design for Concurrency Safety

Document your concurrent tion to address:

* Who is responsible for the concurrency?
* How is the problem space mapped onto concurrency primitives?
* Who is responsible for the synchronization?

```go
// CalculatePi calculates digits of Pi between the  and end place.
//
// Internally, CalculatePi will create FLOOR((end-)/2) concurrent processes
// which recursively call CalculatePi. Synchronization of writes to pi are
// handled internally by the Pi struct.
 CalculatePi(begin, end int64, pi *Pi)
```

# Modeling Your Code

## Concurrency vs Parallelism

The difference between concurrency and parallelism turns out to be a very
powerful abstraction when modeling your code, and Go takes full advantage of
this.

> Concurrency is a property of the code; parallelism is a property of the
  running program.

> Concurrency is about *dealing* with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about
  *doing* lots of things at once.

Consider that we wrote our code with the intent that two chunks of the program
will run in parallel, but if it's run on a machine with only one core, then
it's NOT running in parallel. The important things to note are:

* We do not write parallel code, only concurrent code that we hope will be run
  in parallel. Once again, parallelism is a property of the *runtime* of our
  program, not the code.
* It is possible to be ignorant of whether our concurrent code is actually
  running in parallel. This is only made possible by the *layers of abstraction*
  that lie beneath our program’s model: the concurrency primitives, the
  program’s runtime, the operating system, the platform the operating system
  runs on (in the case of hypervisors, containers, and virtual machines), and
  ultimately the CPUs. These **abstractions are what allow us to make the
  distinction between concurrency and parallelism, and ultimately what give us
  the power and flexibility to express ourselves**.
* Parallelism is a function of time, or *context*. This is important because the
  context you define is closely related to the concept of concurrency and
  correctness. Just as atomic operations can be considered atomic depending on
  the context you define, concurrent operations are correct depending on the
  context you define. It’s all relative.

As we moving down the stack of abstraction, the problem of modeling things
concurrently is becoming both more difficult to reason about, and more
important. Conversely, our abstractions are becoming more and more important to
us. In other words, the more difficult it is to get concurrency right, the more
important it is to have access to concurrency primitives that are easy to
compose. Unfortunately, most concurrent logic in our industry is written at one
of the highest levels of abstraction: OS threads.

Before Go was first revealed to the public, this was where the chain of
abstraction ended for most of the popular programming languages. If you wanted
to write concurrent code, you would model your program in terms of threads
and synchronize the access to the memory between them. If you had a lot of
things you had to model concurrently and your machine couldn’t handle that many
threads, you created a thread pool and multiplexed your operations onto the
thread pool.

Go has added another link in that chain: the goroutine. In addition, Go has
borrowed several concepts from the work of famed computer scientist Tony Hoare,
and introduced new primitives for us to use, namely channels. Threads are still
there, of course, but we find that we rarely have to think about our problem
space in terms of OS threads. Instead, we model things in goroutines and
channels, and occasionally shared memory.

Why is this important? How Go's decoupling concurrency and parallelism can help us?

* Goroutines free us from having to think about our problem space in terms of
  parallelism and instead allow us to **model problems closer to their natural
  level of concurrency**.  This is achieved by a promise Go makes to us: that
  goroutines are lightweight, and we normally won’t have to worry about
  creating one. There are appropriate times to consider how many goroutines are
  running in your system, but doing so upfront is soundly a premature
  optimization. Contrast this with threads where you would be wise to consider
  such matters upfront.
* Go’s runtime **multiplexes goroutines onto OS threads automatically** and
  manages their scheduling for us. This means that optimizations to the runtime
  can be made without us having to change how we’ve modeled our problem; this
  is classic separation of concerns. As advancements in parallelism are made,
  Go’s runtime will improve, as will the performance of your program -- all for
  free.
* Because Go’s runtime is managing the scheduling of goroutines for you, it can
  introspect on things like goroutines blocked waiting for I/O and
  intelligently reallocate OS threads to goroutines that are not blocked.
  This also increases the performance of your code.
* Because the problems we work on as developers are naturally concurrent more
  often than not, we’ll naturally be writing concurrent code at a finer level
  of granularity than we perhaps would in other languages. This finer level of
  granularity enables our program to scale dynamically when it runs to the
  amount of parallelism possible on the program’s host.
* Channels are inherently composable with other channels. This makes writing
  large systems simpler because you can coordinate the input from multiple
  subsystems by easily composing the output together. You can combine input
  channels with timeouts, cancellations, or messages to other subsystems.
  Coordinating mutexes is a much more difficult proposition.
* The select statement is the complement to Go’s channels and is what enables
  all the difficult bits of composing channels. select statements allow you to
  efficiently wait for events, select a message from competing channels in a
  uniform random way, continue on if there are no messages waiting, and more.

## Memory Synchronizations vs CSP primitives

Go support for two style for concurrency. CSP was and is a large part of what Go
was designed around; however, Go also supports more traditional means of
writing concurrent code through memory access synchronization and the
primitives that follow that technique. Structs and methods in the sync and
other packages allow you to perform locks, create pools of resources, preempt
goroutines, and more.

> One of Go’s mottos is “Share memory by communicating, don’t communicate by
  sharing memory.” That said, Go does provide traditional locking mechanisms
  in the sync package. Most locking issues can be solved using either channels
  or traditional locks. So which should you use? Use whichever is most
  expressive and/or most simple.

The way we can mostly differentiate comes from where we’re trying to manage
our concurrency: internally to a tight scope, or exter‐ nally throughout our
system. Here is a decision tree to help you decide:

![](./img/go/concurrency/decision.png)

When working with Go, it's best to discard common patterns for OS thread
concurrency like thread pools: aim for simplicity, use channels when possible,
and treat goroutines like a free resource.

# Goroutine

## Thread, Goroutine, Coroutin

Goroutines are unique to Go (though some other languages have a concurrency
primitive that is similar). They’re not OS threads, and they’re not exactly
"green threads" -- threads that are managed by a language’s runtime -- they’re a
higher level of abstraction known as "coroutines". **Coroutines** are simply
concurrent subroutines (functions, closures, or methods in Go) that are
*nonpreemptive* -- that is, they cannot be interrupted. Instead, coroutines have
multiple points throughout which allow for suspension or reentry.

What makes goroutines unique to Go are their deep integration with Go’s runtime.
Goroutines don’t define their own suspension or reentry points; Go’s runtime
observes the runtime behavior of goroutines and automatically suspends them
when they block and then resumes them when they become unblocked. In a way this
makes them **preemptable, but only at points where the goroutine has become
blocked**. It is an elegant partnership between the runtime and a goroutine’s
logic. Thus, goroutines can be considered **a special class of coroutine**.

## M:N

Go’s mechanism for hosting goroutines is an implementation of what’s called an
**M:N scheduler**, which means it maps M green threads to N OS threads.
Goroutines are then scheduled onto the *green threads*. When we have more
goroutines than green threads available, the scheduler handles the
distribution of the goroutines across the available threads and ensures that
when these goroutines become blocked, other goroutines can be run.

## Fork-Join Model

Go follows a model of concurrency called the **fork-join model**. The word fork
refers to the fact that at any point in the program, it can split off a child
branch of execution to be run concurrently with its parent. The word join
refers to the fact that at some point in the future, these concurrent branches
of execution will join back together.  Where the child rejoins the parent is
called a "join point".

The go statement is how Go performs a fork. Join points are what guarantee our
program’s correctness and remove the race condition. In order to a create a
join point, you have to synchronize the main goroutine and the other
goroutines. This can be done in a number of ways like using sync.Waitgroup.Wait().

## Closure

"Closures" close around the lexical scope they are *created in*, thereby
capturing variables. Since goroutines execute within the **same address
space** they were created in, if you run a closure in a goroutine, the closure
operate on a **copy** of these variables.

## Lightweight

> A newly minted goroutine is given **a few kilobytes**, which is almost always
  enough. When it isn’t, the run-time grows (and shrinks) the memory for
  storing the stack automatically, allowing many goroutines to live in a modest
  amount of memory. The CPU overhead averages about three cheap instructions
  per function call. It is practical to create **hundreds of thousands
  (million) of goroutines in the same address space**.

Regarding the memory size that a noop goroutine takes, for 8GB of RAM, we can
spin up millions of goroutines without requiring swapping:

    Memory (GB)     Goroutines (#/100,000)  Order of magnitude
    2^0             3.718                   3
    2^1             7.436                   3
    2^2             14.873                  6
    2^3             29.746                  6
    2^4             59.492                  6
    2^5             118.983                 6
    2^6             237.967                 6
    2^7             475.934                 6
    2^8             951.867                 6
    2^9             1903.735                9

Regarding context-switching, our benchmark shows that it takes 225ns per context
switch for goroutines, 92% faster than OS context switch.

Creating goroutines is very cheap, and so you should only be discussing their
cost if you’ve proven they are the root cause of a performance issue.

##  GOMAXPROCS

In the runtime package, there is a function called GOMAXPROCS. In my opinion,
the name is misleading: people often think this function relates to the number
of logical processors on the host machine -- and in a roundabout way it does --
but really this function controls the **number of OS threads that will host
so-called “work queues.”**

# The sync Package

## WaitGroup

See basic/sync/waitgroup.

## Mutex, RWMutex

See basic/sync/mutex.

It’s usually advisable to use RWMutex instead of Mutex when it logically makes
sense.

## Cond

> ...a rendezvous point for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence
> of an event.

An “event” is any arbitrary signal between two or more goroutines that carries
no information other than the fact that it has occurred.

Naive approachs would be:

```go
// 1. this would consume all cycles of one core:
for conditionTrue() == false {
}

// 2. still inefficient, have to figure out the right sleeping time:
for conditionTrue() == false {
    time.Sleep(1*time.Millisecond)
}
```

It would be nice if there is a way for a goroutine to **efficiently sleep
until it was signaled to wake and check its condition**, this is what Cond
for.

Typical pattern when using Cond:

```go
// Newcond() receive a sync.Locker interface value, which allow Cond
// faciliatate coordination with other goroutines in concurrent-safe way.
c := sync.NewCond(&sync.Mutex{})
// It's necessary to Lock the locker because the call to Wait automatically
// calls Unlock on the locker when entered.
c.L.Lock()
for conditionTrue() == false {
    // calling Wait will block and suspend the goroutine, wait to be notified.
    c.Wait()
}
// It's necessary to Unlock the locker because when call to Wait exits, it will
// automatically calls Lock on the locker.
c.L.Unlock()
```

Note since Wait() will **auto call Unlock() when enter and Lock() when exit**,
so Lock before Wait and Unlock after awoken is essential, this also mean
although it looks like we hold a lock the entire block, but it's NOT. The call
to Wait **doesn’t just block, it suspends the current goroutine, allowing other
goroutines to run on the OS thread**.

Unicast and Broadcast

How do we notify the Wait blocked goroutine to check the condition? there are
two ways: unicast event with Signal() and broadcast event with Broadcast().

Internally, the runtime maintains a FIFO list of goroutines waiting to be
signaled; Signal finds the goroutine that’s been waiting the longest and
notifies it, whereas Broadcast sends a signal to all goroutines that are
waiting.

VS Channels

We can trivially reproduce Signal with channels but reproducing the behavior of
**repeated calls to Broadcast** would be more difficult. This is something
channels can’t do easily and thus is one of **the main reasons** to utilize
the Cond type.

In addition, the Cond type is much more performant than utilizing channels.

Like most other things in the sync package, usage of Cond works best when
constrained to a tight scope, or exposed to a broader scope through a type that
encapsulates it.

## Once

sync.Once is a type that utilizes some sync primitives internally to ensure that
only one call to Do ever calls the function passed in -- **even on different
goroutines**.

sync.Once **only counts the number of times Do is called**, not how many times
unique functions passed into Do are called. In this way, copies of sync.Once
are *tightly coupled* to the functions they are intended to be called with.

I recommend that you formalize this coupling by **wrapping any usage of
sync.Once in a small lexical block**: either a small function, or by wrapping
both in a type.

## Pool

Pool is a concurrent-safe implementation of the object pool pattern. the pool
pattern is a way to create and make available a fixed number, or pool, of
things for use. It’s commonly used to constrain the creation of things that are
expensive.

The object pool design pattern is best used either when you have concurrent
processes that require objects, but dispose of them very rapidly after
instantiation, or when construction of these objects could negatively impact
memory.

There is one thing to be wary of when determining whether or not you should
utilize a Pool: if the code that utilizes the Pool requires things that are not
roughly *homogenous*, you may spend more time converting what you’ve retrieved
from the Pool than it would have taken to just instantiate it in the first
place.

# Channel

Channels are one of the synchronization primitives in Go derived from Hoare’s
CSP. While they can be used to synchronize access of the memory, they are best
used to communicate information between goroutines.

Channel Behavior

     Operation       Channel State       Result
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     read            nil                 block
                     open and not empty  value
                     open and empty      block
                     closed              default value, false
                     write only          compile error
     write           nil                 block
                     open and full       block
                     open and not full   write value
                     closed              panic !!
                     receive only        compile error
     close           nil                 panic !!
                     open and not empty  close channel, read succeed until drained,
                                         then reads produce default value
                     open and empty      close channel, read produces default value
                     closed              panic !!
                     receive only        compile error

Buffered Channel

An unbuffered channel has a capacity of zero and so it’s already full before any
writes. A buffered channel with no receivers and a capacity of four would be
full after four writes, and block on the fifth write since it has nowhere else
to place the fifth element. Like unbuffered channels, buffered channels are
still blocking; the preconditions that the channel be empty or full are just
different.

If a buffered channel is empty and has a receiver, the buffer will
be **bypassed** and the value will be passed directly from the sender to the
receiver. In practice, this happens transparently.

Buffered channels can be useful in certain situations, but you should create
them with care. buffered channels can easily become a premature optimization
and also **hide deadlocks by making them more unlikely to happen**.

An valid usage of buffered channels for optimization is: if a goroutine making
writes to a channel **has knowledge of how many writes it will make**, it can
be useful to create a buffered channel whose capacity is the number of writes
to be made, and then make those writes as quickly as possible. But there are
caveats using buffered channelss, see #Queue.

## Design

How can we organize channels to make using them more robust and stable?

The first thing we should do to put channels in the right context is to assign
channel ownership. I’ll define **ownership** as being a goroutine that
**instantiates, writes, and closes** a channel. Much like memory in languages
without garbage collection, it’s important to clarify which goroutine owns a
channel in order to reason about our programs logically. Unidirectional channel
declarations are the tool that will allow us to distinguish between goroutines
that own channels and those that only utilize them: channel owners have a
write-access view into the channel (chan or chan<-), and channel utilizers only
have a read-only view into the channel (<-chan).

Once we make this distinction between channel owners and nonchannel owners, the
results from the preceding table follow naturally, then we can begin to assign
**responsibilities** to goroutines that own channels and those that do not.

Responsibility

    Owner                       Consumer
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    creation                    read
    write / pass ownership      handle block:timeout/stop/forever...
    close                       handle close
    ecapsulate / expose

We should try to do what we can in our programs to keep the scope of channel
ownership small so that these things remain obvious. If you have a channel as a
member variable of a struct with numerous methods on it, it’s going to quickly
become unclear how the channel will behave.

# Select

If channels are the glue that binds goroutines together, then the select
statement is the glue that binds channels together; it’s how we’re able to
compose channels together in a program to form larger abstractions, and that's
the real fun when we start composing channels to form higher-order concurrency
design patterns. select statements can help to safely bring channels together
with concepts like cancellations, timeouts, waiting, and default values.

Each case has an *equal chance* of being selected. The reasoning behind this is:
the Go runtime cannot know anything about the intent of your select statement;
that is, it cannot infer your problem space or why you placed a group of
channels together into a select statement. Because of this, the best thing the
Go runtime can hope to do is to work well in the average case.

# Confinement

When working with concurrent code, there are a few different options for safe
operation:

1. Synchronization primitives for sharing memory (e.g., sync.Mutex)
2. Synchronization via communicating (e.g., channels)

Implicitly safe options:

3. Immutable data

Each concurrent process may operate on the same data, but it may not modify it.
If it wants to create new data, it must create a **new copy** of the data with the
desired modifications. This allows not only a lighter cognitive load on the
developer, but can also lead to faster programs if it leads to smaller critical
sections(or eliminates them altogether). In Go, you can achieve this by
writing code that utilizes copies of values instead of pointers to values in
memory.

4. Data protected by confinement

"Confinement" ensure information is only ever available from **one concurrent
process**. When this is achieved, a concurrent program is implicitly safe and
no synchronization is needed. There are two kinds of confinement possible:

* "Ad hoc confinement" is when you achieve confinement through a convention.
   sticking to convention is difficult to achieve on projects of any size
   unless you have tools to perform static analysis on your code every time
   someone commits some code.

* "Lexical Confinement" involves using lexical scope to expose only the correct
   data and concurrency primitives for multiple concurrent processes to use. It
   makes it impossible to do the wrong thing.

Lexical Confinement VS Synchronization

Why pursue confinement when we have synchronization available to us? The answer
is improved performance and reduced cognitive load on developers.
Synchronization comes with a cost, and if you can avoid it you won’t have any
critical sections, and therefore you won’t have to pay the cost of
synchronizing them. You also sidestep an entire class of issues possible with
synchronization; developers simply don’t have to worry about these issues.
Concurrent code that utilizes lexical confinement also has the benefit of
usually being simpler to understand than concurrent code without lexically
confined variables. This is because within the context of your lexical scope
you can write synchronous code.

# For-Select Loop

for-select is often being used in these scenarios:

* Sending iteration variables out on a channel.

```go
for _, s := range []string{"a", "b", "c"} {
    select {
    case <-done:
        return
    case stringStream <- s:
    }
}
```

* Looping infinitely waiting to be stopped.

```go
// Variant 1: keep the select as short as possible
for {
    select {
    case <-done:
        return
    default:
    }
    // Do non-preemptable work
}

// Variant 2: embeds works in the default clause.
for {
    select {
    case <-done:
        return
    default:
        // Do non-preemptable work
    }
}
```

# Preventing Goroutine Leaks By Cancellation

Goroutine need to stop when:

* When it has completed its work.
* When it cannot continue its work due to an unrecoverable error.
* When it’s told to stop working.

We get the first two stop path for free -- your algorithm.

For the third path -- "work cancellation" -- it's the most important bit because
of the "network effect": if you’ve begun a goroutine, it’s most likely
cooperating with several other goroutines in some sort of organized fashion. We
could even represent this interconnectedness as a graph: whether or not a child
goroutine should continue executing might be predicated on knowledge of the
state of many other goroutines. The parent goroutine (often the main goroutine)
with this full contextual knowledge should be able to tell its child goroutines
to terminate.

We’ll continue looking at large-scale goroutine interdependence later, but for
now let’s consider how to ensure a single child goroutine is guaranteed to be
cleaned up.

## Cancellation

How we ensure goroutines are able to be stopped can differ depending on the type
and purpose of goroutine, but they all build on the foundation of **passing in a
done channel**. We can establish a signal between the parent goroutine and its
children that allows the parent to signal cancellation to its children. By
convention, this signal is usually a **read-only channel named done**. The
parent goroutine passes this channel to the child goroutine and then closes the
channel when it wants to cancel the child goroutine.

We can stipulate a convention: **If a goroutine is responsible for creating a
goroutine, it is also responsible for ensuring it can stop the goroutine**.

# Or-Channel

Sometimes we may want to **combine one or more done channels into a single done
channel** that closes if any of its component channels close. To do this:

* If we know the number of done channels, It is perfectly acceptable, albeit
  verbose, to write a select statement that performs this coupling.
* However, sometimes you can’t know the number of done channels you’re working
  with at runtime, or just prefer a one-liner. In those cases, we can combine
  these channels together using the "or-channel pattern".

This pattern creates a composite done channel through recursion and goroutines.
It is useful to employ at the **intersection of modules** in your system. At
these intersections, you tend to have multiple conditions for canceling trees
of goroutines through your call stack. Using the Or function, you can simply
combine these together and pass it down the stack.

Another way of doing this is context. See #context.

# Error Handling Inside Concurrent Goroutines

Because a concurrent process is operating independently of its parent or
siblings, it can be difficult for it to reason about what the right thing to do
with the error is. So concurrent processes should send their errors to another
part of your program that has complete information about the state of your
program, and can make a more informed decision about what to do.

If a goroutine can produce errors, those errors should be tightly coupled with
its result type, and passed along through the same lines of communication --
just like regular synchronous functions.

# Pipeline

A "pipeline" is just another tool we can use to form an abstraction in our
system. It is a very powerful tool to use when your program needs to process
**streams, or batches** of data. A pipeline is nothing more than a series of
things that take data in, perform an operation on it, and pass the data back
out. We call each of these operations a "stage" of the pipeline.

By using a pipeline, we separate the concerns of each stage, which provides
numerous benefits. We can:

* Modify stages independent of one another.
* Mix and match how stages are combined independent of modifying the stages.
* Process each stage concurrent to upstream or downstream stages.
* We can fan-out (See #Fanout).
* Or rate-limit portions of your pipeline.

Stage

Pipeline stages are very closely related to functional programming and can be
considered a subset of "monads". We can combine stages because they must have
these proerties:

* A stage consumes and returns the **same** type. Following this rules enables
  use to compose the same stages for any number of times, or compose different
  stages together.
* A stage must be "reified" by the language so that it may be passed around.
  Functions in Go are reified and fit this purpose nicely.

## Constructing With Channel

Channels are uniquely suited to constructing pipelines in Go because they
fulfill all of our basic requirements: They can receive and emit values, they
can safely be used concurrently, they can be ranged over, and they are reified
by the language.

A "generator" function converts a discrete set of values into a stream of data
on a channel. Aptly, this type of function is called a generator. You’ll see
this frequently when working with pipelines because at the beginning of the
pipeline, you’ll always have some batch of data that you need to convert to a
channel.

## Performance

Generally, the limiting factor on your pipeline will either be your generator,
or one of the stages that is computationally intensive. If the generator isn’t
creating a stream from memory generators, you’ll probably be I/O bound. Reading
from disk or the network may also limit the performance of pipelines.

As for stages being computationally expensive, Fan-in Fan-out can help us, See
Fan-in, Fan-out.


# Fan-Out, Fan-In

Stages in pipeline can be particularly computationally expensive. When this
happens, upstream stages in pipeline can become blocked while waiting for the
expensive stages to complete, as a result, the pipeline itself can take a long
time to execute as a whole.

To address this, we can reuse a single stage of our pipeline on multiple
goroutines in an attempt to parallelize pulls from an upstream stage.

"Fan-out" is a term to describe the process of starting multiple goroutines to
handle input from the pipeline.

"Fan-in" is a term to describe the process of combining multiple results into
one channel.

We might consider fanning out one of your stages if both of the following
apply:

* It takes a long time to run.
* It doesn’t rely on values that the stage had calculated before. The property
  of **order-independence** is important because you have no guarantee in what
  order concurrent copies of your stage will run, nor in what order they will
  return.

# Or-Done Channel

At times we will be working with channels from disparate parts of your system,
which we don't have control of, so we can’t make any assertions about how a
channel will behave when the goroutine you’re working with is canceled via its
done channel. That is to say, **you don’t know if the fact that your goroutine
was canceled means the channel your goroutine is reading from will have been
canceled**. For this reason, we've learned to wrap our read from the channel
with a select statement that also selects from a done channel. This is
perfectly fine, but doing so takes code that’s easily read like this:

```go
loop:
for {
    select {
    case <-done:
        break loop
    case maybeVal, ok := <-myChan:
        if ok == false {
            return // or maybe break out of for-loop.
        }
        // Do something with val
    }
}
```

We wrap the common pattern seen in cancellation and pipeline stages into an
or-done channel, so we can get back from the verbosity to a simple for loops
like this:

```go
for val := range orDone(done, myChan) {
    // Do something with val
}
```

# Tee Channel

Sometimes we may want to split values coming in from a channel so that we can
send them off into two separate areas of our codebase. Imagine a channel of
user commands: we might want to take in a stream of user commands on a
channel, send them to something that executes them, and also send them to
something that logs the commands for later auditing.

Tee-channel does this. you pass it a channel to read from, and it will return
two separate channels that will get the same value.

Utilizing this pattern, it’s easy to continue using channels as the join points
of our system.

# Bridge Channel

In some circumstances, we may want to consume values from **a sequence of
channels**:

    <-chan <-chan interface{}

This is slightly different than coalescing a slice of channels into a single
channel, as we saw in or channel or fan-out/fan-in. A sequence of channels
suggests an *ordered write*, albeit from different sources.

As a consumer, the code not care about the fact that its values come from a
sequence of channels. In that case, dealing with a channel of channels can be
cumbersome. Instead, we can define a function that can destructure the channel
of channels into a simple channel — a technique called "bridging" the channels.
We can use bridge to help present a single channel facade over a channel of
channels.

# Queuing

Sometimes it’s useful **to begin accepting work for your pipeline even though
the pipeline is not yet ready for more**. This process is called "queuing". It
means that once your stage has completed some work, it stores it in a temporary
location in memory so that other stages can retrieve it later, and your stage
doesn’t need to hold a reference to it.

It’s usually one of **the last techniques** you want to employ when optimizing
your program. Adding queuing prematurely **can hide synchronization issues**
such as deadlocks and livelocks. Queuing will almost never speed up the *total*
runtime of your program; it will only allow the program to behave differently.

The utility of introducing a queue isn’t that the runtime of one of stages has
been reduced, but rather that the time it’s in a blocking state is reduced. In
this way, the true utility of queues is to **decouple stages so that the
runtime of one stage has no impact on the runtime of another**. Decoupling
stages in this manner then cascades to alter the runtime behavior of the system
as a whole, which can be either good or bad depending on your system.

Consider this pipeline:

    p := processRequest(done, acceptConnection(done, httpHandler))

We wouldn’t want connections to your program to begin timing out because
processRequest stage was blocking acceptConnection stage. We want
acceptConnection stage to be unblocked as much as possible. In this case, we
can use a queue for help.

## When And Where

The situation queuing can increase the overall performance of your system are:

1. If batching requests in a stage saves time.

Chunking

In bufio.Writer, the writes are queued internally into a buffer until a
sufficient chunk has been accumulated, and then the chunk is written out. This
process is often called "chunking".

Chunking is faster because bytes.Buffer must grow its allocated memory to
accommodate the bytes it must store. For various reasons, growing memory is
expensive; therefore, the less times we have to grow, the more efficient our
system as a whole will perform. Thus, queuing has increased the performance of
our system as a whole.

Usually anytime performing an operation requires an overhead, chunking may
increase system performance. Some examples of this are opening database
transactions, calculating message checksums, and allocating contiguous space.

Lookbehind, Ordering

Aside from chunking, queuing can also help if your algorithm can be optimized by
supporting lookbehinds, or ordering.

2. If delays in a stage produce a feedback loop into the system.

Death-Spiral

If a delay in a stage causes more input into the pipeline, it can lead to a
systemic collapse of your upstream systems. This is often referred as a
"negative feedback loop", "downward-spiral", or even "death-spiral". Without
some sort of **fail-safe**, the system utilizing the pipeline will never recover.

By introducing a queue **at the entrance** to the pipeline, you can break the
feedback loop at the cost of creating lag for requests. From the perspective of
the caller into the pipeline, the request appears to be processing, but taking
a very long time. As long as the **caller doesn’t time out, your pipeline will
remain stable. If the caller does time out, you need to be sure you support
some kind of check for readiness when dequeuing. If you don’t, you can
inadvertently create a feedback loop by processing dead requests** thereby
decreasing the efficiency of your pipeline.

In this case,  queuing should be implemented either:

* At the entrance to your pipeline.
* In stages where batching will lead to higher efficiency.

**Avoid adding queue elsewhere**, like after a computationally expensive stage.
As we’ve learned, there are only a few situations where queuing will decrease
the runtime of your pipeline, and peppering in queuing in an attempt to work
around this can have disastrous consequences.

## What Size, Little's Law

In queuing theory, there is a law that — with enough sampling — predicts the
throughput of your pipeline. It’s called Little’s Law. It's commonly
expressed as:

    L=λW

* L = the average number of units in the system.
* λ = the average arrival rate of units.
* W = the average time a unit spends in the system.

This equation **only applies to so-called stable systems**. In a pipeline, a
"stable system" is one in which the rate that work enters the pipeline,
or "ingress", is equal to the rate in which it exits the system, or "egress".
If the rate of ingress exceeds the rate of egress, your system is unstable and
has entered a "death-spiral". If the rate of ingress is less than the rate of
egress, you still have an "unstable" system, but all that’s happening is that
your resources aren’t being utilized completely.

So let’s assume that our pipeline is stable. If we want to **decrease W**, the
average time a unit spends in the system by a factor of n, we only have one
option: to decrease the average number of units in the system, and we can only
decrease the average number of units in the system if we increase the rate of
egress:  (@?? why NOT nλ ?):

    L/n = λ * W/n

Also notice that if we **add queues to our stages, we’re increasing L**, which
either increases the arrival rate of units (nL = nλ * W) or increases the
average time a unit spends in the system (nL = λ * nW). Through Little’s Law,
we can see that queuing will not help decrease the amount of time spent in a
system.

Using little's law, we can determine:

* How many requests per second our pipeline can handle?
* How large our queue needs to be to handle a desired number of requests?

Let's how little's law help us with analysing our pipeline. Suppose we have a
pipeline of 3 stages, we can answer these questions with the help of little's
law:

* How many requests per second our pipeline can handle, i.e. what's the value of
  λ?

Suppose we've enabled sampling and find that 1 request (r) takes about 1 second
to make it throught the pipeline (W=1s). Now we plug the value W=1s and
L=3r (because each stage in pipeline is processing a request) into the
equation:

    3r   = λr/s * 1s
    3r/s = λr/s
    λr/s = 3r/s

and get the answer: we can handle three requests per second.

* How large our queue needs to be to handle a desired number of requests?

Suppose our sampling shows a request takes 1ms to process (W=0.0001s), and we
want to handle 100,000 requests per second (λ=100000r/s). We plug the values in.
We decrement L by 3 because our pipeline have 3 stages.

    Lr = 100000r/s * 0.0001s
    Lr = 10r
    Lr - 3r = 7r

and get the answer: our queue should have a capacity of 7.

## Persistent Queue

Something that **Little’s Law can’t provide insight on is handling failure**.
Keep in mind that if for some reason your pipeline panics, you’ll lose all the
requests in your queue. To mitigate this, you can either stick to a queue size
of zero, or you can move to a "persistent queue", which is simply a queue that
is persisted somewhere that can be later read from should the need arise.

# Context Package

The context package let us communicate extra information alongside the simple
notification to cancel: why the cancellation was occuring, or whether or not
our function has a deadline by which it needs to complete. It serves two
primary purposes:

* To provide an API for canceling branches of your call-graph.
* To provide a data-bag for transporting request-scoped data through your
  callgraph.

## API

Context Type

```go
type Context interface {
    // Deadline returns the time when work done on behalf of this context should
    // be canceled. Deadline returns ok==false when no deadline is set.
    // Successive calls to Deadline return the same results.
    Deadline() (deadline time.Time, ok bool)

    // Done returns a channel that's closed when work done on behalf of this
    // context should be canceled. Done may return nil if this context can
    // never be canceled. Successive calls to Done return the same value.
    Done() <-chan struct{}

    // Err returns a non-nil error value after Done is closed. Err returns
    // Canceled if the context was canceled or DeadlineExceeded if the
    // context's deadline passed. No other values for Err are defined.  After
    // Done is closed, successive calls to Err return the same value.
    Err() error

    // Value returns the value associated with this context for key, or nil if
    // no value is associated with key. Successive calls to Value with the same
    // key returns the same result.
    Value(key interface{}) interface{}
}
```

The Context type will flow through your system much like a done channel does,
it’s important to always pass instances of Context into your functions. It can
be created with these two functions:

    func Background() Context
    func TODO() Context

Background simply returns an empty Context. TODO is not meant for use in
production, but also returns an empty Context; TODO’s intended purpose is to
serve as a **placeholder** for when you don’t know which Context to utilize, or
if you expect your code to be provided with a Context, but the upstream code
hasn’t yet furnished one.

Cancellation

    func WithCancel(parent Context) (ctx Context, cancel CancelFunc)
    func WithDeadline(parent Context, deadline time.Time) (Context, CancelFunc)
    func WithTimeout(parent Context, timeout time.Duration) (Context, CancelFunc)

WithCancel returns a new Context that closes its done channel when the returned
cancel function is called. WithDeadline returns a new Context that closes its
done channel when the machine’s clock advances past the given deadline.
WithTimeout returns a new Context that closes its done channel after the given
timeout duration.

Scoped Data

* The key must satisfy Go’s notion of comparability; that is, the equality
  operators == and != need to return correct results when used.
* Values returned **must be safe** to access from multiple goroutines.

## Smart Cancel Logic

Context help us if we want to do something like:

* Parent operation only wants to wait one second before abandoning the call to
  a slow subroutine.
* If one operation is unsuccessful, we also want to cancel another.
* For slow operation, it might want to check whether a deadline is given.

## Customized Key Type

Since both the Context’s key and value are defined as *interface{}*, we lose
Go’s typesafety when attempting to retrieve values. For these reasons, the Go
authors recommend us to follow a few rules when storing and retrieving value
from a Context.

* Define a custom key-type in our package. As long as other packages do the
  same, this prevents collisions within the Context.
* Since we don’t export the keys we use to store the data, we must therefore
  export functions that retrieve the data for us. This works out nicely since
  it allows consumers of this data to use static, type-safe functions.

But this approach might introduce a **circular reference problem**, and coerces
the architecture into creating packages centered around data types that are
imported from multiple locations. This certainly isn’t a bad thing, but it’s
something to be aware of.

## Design: Pass Context as Argument

See <https://go.dev/blog/context-and-structs>.

Context should **not be stored inside a struct** type, but instead passed to
each function that needs it. It has the following advantages:

* users can set per-call deadlines, cancellation, and metadata.
* context is scoped to as small an operation as it needs to be, which greatly
  increases the utility and clarity of context in this package.

An exception to this rule, is when for preserving backwards compatibility. For
example, the package net/http in stdlib chose to add a context.Context on the
http.Request struct in order to allow support context.Context without breaking
backwards compatibility.

## Design: What To Store?

The context package hasn’t been uniformly lauded. Within the Go community, the
context package has been somewhat controversial. The cancellation aspect of the
package has been pretty well received, but the ability to store arbitrary data
in a Context, and the type-unsafe manner in which the data is stored, have
caused some divisiveness:

* Although we have partially abated the lack of type-safety with custome typed
  key and accessor functions, we **could still introduce bugs** by storing
  incorrect types.
* However, the larger issue is definitely the nature of **what developers should
  store** in instances of Context.

Quoting from the official package comments:

> Use context values only for *request-scoped* data that transits processes and
  API boundaries, not for passing optional parameters to functions.

But this is still ambiguous. The best way I’ve found is to come up with some
**heuristics with your team, and evaluate them in code reviews**. Here are some
example heuristics:

1. The data should transit process or API boundaries. If you generate the data
in your process’ memory, it’s probably not a good candidate to be
request-scoped data unless you also pass it across an API boundary.

2. The data should be immutable. If it’s not, then by definition what you’re
storing did not come from the request.

3. The data should trend toward simple types. If request-scoped data is meant to
transit process and API boundaries, it’s much easier for the other side to pull
this data out if it doesn’t also have to import a complex graph of packages.

4. The data should be data, not types with methods. Operations are logic and
belong on the things consuming this data.

5. The data should help decorate operations, not drive them. If your algorithm
behaves differently based on what is or isn’t included in its Context, you have
likely crossed over into the territory of "optional parameters".

For example:

    Data                    1   2   3   4   5
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Request ID              Y   Y   Y   Y   Y
    User ID                 Y   Y   Y   Y
    URL                     Y   Y
    API Authorization Token Y   Y   Y   Y
    Request Token           Y   Y   Y

## Design: Verbosity Or Dependency?

Another dimension to consider is how many layers this data might need to
traverse before utilization. If there are a few frameworks and tens of
functions between where the data is accepted and where it is used, do you want
to lean toward verbose, self documenting function signatures, and add the data
as a parameter? Or would you rather place it in a Context and thereby create an
invisible dependency? There are merits to each approach, and in the end it’s a
decision you and your team will have to make.

# Error Propagation

We should carefully considering how issues propagate through our system, and
how they end up being represented to the user.

Let consider what info should an "error" contain:

* What happened. e.g., “disk full,” “socket closed,” or “credentials expired.”
  we can decorate this with some context that will help the user.
* When and where it occurred. Errors should always contain a **complete stack
  trace** starting with how the call was initiated and ending with where the
  error was instantiated. The stack trace should not be contained in the error
  message(more on this in a bit), but should be easily accessible when handling
  the error up the stack. Further, the error should contain information
  regarding the context it’s running within. For example, in a distributed
  system, it should have some way of identifying what machine the error
  occurred on. Later, when trying to understand what happened in your system,
  this information will be invaluable. In addition, the error should contain
  the time on the machine the error was instantiated on, **in UTC**.
* A friendly user-facing message. The message that gets displayed to the user
  should be customized to suit your system and its users. It should only
  contain abbreviated and relevant information **from the previous two
  points**. A friendly message is human-centric, gives some indication of
  **whether the issue is transitory**, and should be about one line of text.
* How the user can get more information. At some point, someone will likely want
  to know, in detail, what happened when the error occurred. Errors that are
  presented to users should provide an **ID that can be cross-referenced** to a
  corresponding log that displays the full information of the error: time the
  error occurred (not the time the error was logged), the stack trace --
  everything you stuffed into the error when it was created. It can also be
  helpful to include **a hash of the stack trace to aid in aggregating** like
  issues in bug trackers.

Mal-formed Bugs and Well-formed Errors

We can take the stance that any error that is propagated to the user without
this information is a mistake, and therefore a bug.

This requires that at the **boundaries** of each component, all incoming errors
must be wrapped in a well-formed error for the component our code is within.
Hence any error that escapes our module without our module’s error type can be
considered malformed, and a bug.

Note that it is only necessary to wrap errors in these cases:

* at your own module boundaries (public functions/methods)
* or when your code can add valuable context.

Usually this prevents the need for wrapping errors in most of the code.

Log And Display

All errors should be logged with as much information as is available.

But when displaying errors to users, this is where the distinction between bugs
and known edge cases comes in.

* When our user-facing code receives a well-formed error, we can be confident
  that at all levels in our code, care was taken to craft the error message,
  and we can simply log it and print it out for the user to see.
* When malformed errors, or bugs, are propagated up to the user, we should also
  log the error, but then display a friendly message to the user stating
  something unexpected has happened. If we support automatic error reporting in
  our system, the error should be reported back as a bug. If we don’t, we might
  suggest the user file a bug report. Note that the malformed error might
  actually contain useful information, but we cannot guarantee this, since the
  only guarantee we do have is that the error is not customized, so we should
  bluntly display a human-centric message about what happened.

# Timeout, Cancellation

When designing your concurrent processes, be sure to take into account timeouts
and cancellation. Like many other topics in software engineering, neglecting
timeouts and cancellation from the beginning and then attempting to put them in
later is a bit like trying to add eggs to a cake after it has been baked.

Cancellation is a natual response to a timeout, but let's analyse timeout and
cacellation separately here.

## Timout

We might want to support timeout for these reasons:

* If our system is **saturated**, its ability to process requests is at
  capacity, we may want requests at the *edges* of our system to time out
  rather than take a long time to field them.

* Some data has a **window** within which it must be processed. If a concurrent
  process takes longer to process the data than this window, we would want to
  time out and cancel the concurrent process. For instance, if our concurrent
  process is dequeing a request after a long wait, the request or its data
  might have become obsolete during the queuing process.

    - If this window is known beforehand, it would make sense to pass our
      concurrent process a context.Context created with context.WithDeadline,
      or context.WithTimeout.
    - If the window is not known beforehand, we’d want the parent of the
      concurrent process to be able to cancel the concurrent process when the
      need for the request is no longer present. context.WithCancel is perfect
      for this purpose.

* In a large system, especially distributed systems, it can sometimes be
  difficult to understand the way in which data might flow, or what edge cases
  might turn up. It is not unreasonable, and even recommended, to place
  timeouts on *all* of your concurrent operations to guarantee your system
  won’t deadlock. The timeout period doesn’t have to be close to the actual
  time it takes to perform your concurrent operation. The timeout period’s
  purpose is **only to prevent deadlock**, and so it only needs to be short
  enough that a deadlocked system will unblock in a reasonable amount of time
  for your use case. Note that this isn’t a recommendation for how to build a
  system correctly; rather a suggestion for building a system that is tolerant
  to timing errors you may not have exercised during development and testing. I
  do recommend you keep the timeouts in place, but the **goal should be to
  converge on a system without deadlocks where the timeouts are never
  triggered**.

## Cancellation

We've seen to ways to implement cancellation: done channel and Context type.
When writing concurrent code that can be terminated at any time, we need to
keep this considerations in head:

1. Preemptability.
2. Shared State.
3. Duplicated Messages.

Preemptablility

Look at this code:

```go
reallyLongCalculation := func(
    done <-chan interface{},
    value interface{},
) interface{} {
    intermediateResult := longCalculation(value)
    select {
    case <-done:
        return nil
    default:
    }
    return longCalculation(intermediateResult)
}
```

We've made the effort using the done channel to make reallyLongCalculation to be
preemptable, but notice that it can only be preempted between the two
longCalculation function calls, should we continue and make longCalculation also
preemptable?

The guideline is: **Define the period** within which our concurrent process is
preemptable, and ensure that any functionality that takes more time than this
period is itself preemptable. An easy way to do this is to **break up** the
pieces of your goroutine into smaller pieces. You should **aim for all
nonpreemptable atomic operations to complete in less time than the period**
you’ve deemed acceptable.

Shared State

If our goroutine happens to modify shared state, like a database, a file, an
in-memory data structure, what happens when the goroutine is canceled? Does our
goroutine try and roll back the intermediary work it’s done? How long does it
have to do this work?

If we **keep the modifications to any shared state within a tight scope, and/or
ensure those modifications are easily rolled back**, we can usually handle
cancellations pretty well. If possible, build up intermediate results in-memory
and then modify state as quickly as possible.

Duplicated Messages

Let’s say you have a pipeline with three stages: a generator stage, stage A, and
stage B. The generator stage monitors stage A by keeping track of how long
it’s been since it last read from its channel, and brings up a new instance,
A2, if the current instance becomes nonperformant. If that were to happen, it
is possible for stage B to receive duplicate messages.

We can handle this problem with these approaches:

* Heartbeat (See #Heartbeat).
* If your algorithm allows it, or your concurrent process is *idempotent*, you
  can simply allow for the possibility of duplicate messages in your downstream
  processes and choose whether to accept the first or last message you receive.
* You can use bidirectional communication with your parent to explicitly request
  permission to send your message. However, in practice, this is rarely
  necessary, and since it is more complicated than heartbeats, and heartbeats
  are more generally useful, I suggest you just use heartbeats.

# Heartbeat

Heartbeats are a way for concurrent processes to signal life to outside parties.
They allow us insights into our system, and they can make testing the system
deterministic when it might otherwise not be.

We discuss two type of heartbeat here:

* Heartbeats that occur on a time interval.
* Heartbeats that occur at the beginning of a unit of work.

We will take the concept of heartbeat further in #Healing_Unhealty_Goroutines.

## Heartbeat At Time Interval

Time-interval based heartbeat is useful for concurrent code that might be
waiting for something else to happen for it to process a unit of work. Because
the goroutine that processing those units of works doesn’t know when that work
might come in, it might be sitting around for a while waiting for something to
happen. A heartbeat is a way to signal to its listeners that everything is
well, and that the silence is expected.

In a properly functioning system, heartbeats aren’t that interesting. We might
use them to gather statistics regarding idle time, but the utility for
interval-based heartbeats really shines when your goroutine isn’t behaving as
expected. By using a heartbeat, we can avoid deadlock, and remain deterministic
by not having to rely on a longer timeout.

## Heartbeat At Work Begin

This kind of heartbeat is extremely useful **for tests**, interval-based
heartbeats can be used in the same fashion, but if you **only care that the
goroutine has started doing its work**, this style of heartbeat is simpler.

# Replicated Requests

If receiving a response as quickly as possible is the top priority, we can make
a trade-off: either replicate the request to multiple handlers(whether those be
goroutines, processes, or servers), and one of them will return faster than the
other ones; we can then immediately return the result. The downside is that
you’ll have to utilize resources to keep multiple copies of the handlers
running.

If this replication is done in-memory, it might not be that costly, but if
replicating the handlers requires replicating processes, servers, or even data
centers, this can become quite costly. The decision you’ll have to make is
whether or not the cost is worth the benefit.

This pattern have a caveat we need to watch out: all of your handlers need to
have **equal opportunity** to service the request. Otherwise we might lose the
chance receiving the result from the fastest handler because it can’t service
the request. Also, whatever resources the handlers are using to do their job
need to be replicated as well.

A different symptom of the same problem is "uniformity". If our handlers are too
much alike, the chances that any one will be an outlier is smaller. You should
only replicate out requests like this to handlers that have **different runtime
conditions**: different processes, machines, paths to a data store, or access
to different data stores altogether. Although this can be expensive to set up
and maintain, if **speed** is our goal, it is a valuable technique. In
addition, this technique also provides **fault tolerance**
and **scalability**.

# Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is typically used in service API to achieve these goals:

* Prevent attackes like DDoS.
* Prevent the effect of overloading cascade through the system.
* Keep the performance gurantees to our users.
* Keep our system's performance and stability in boundaries, if we need to
  expand those boundaries, we can do so in a controlled manner.

But note that rate limiting can also be used by users, i.e. to keep the API
budgets in control.

In a basic rate limiting implementation, there is only one rate limiter; for
more complex requirements, we can also implment a mult-tier rate limiting, in
which request is limited by the first restrictive-enough rate limiter.

Also, aside from limiting rate by time, we can limit by other dimensions like
disk access, network access, etc.

## Token Bucket

Most rate limiting is done by utilizing an algorithm called the "token bucket":
every time you need to access a resource, you reach into the bucket and remove
a token.

When implementing token bucket, there are two settings we can fiddle with:

* the "depth" of the bucket: how many tokens are available for immediate use.
* the rate at which tokens are replenished.

Using these two we can control both the "burstiness" and "overall rate limit".
Burstiness simply means how many requests can be made when the bucket is full.

# Healing Unhealthy Goroutines

In long-lived processes such as daemons, goroutines are usually blocked, waiting
on data to come to them through some means, so that they can wake up, do their
work, and then pass the data on. Sometimes the goroutines are dependent on a
resource that you don’t have very good control of. The point is that it can be
very easy for a goroutine to **become stuck in a bad state from which it cannot
recover without external help**. If you separate your concerns, you might even
say that it shouldn’t be the concern of a goroutine doing work to know how to
heal itself from a bad state. In a long-running process, it can be useful to
create a mechanism that ensures your goroutines remain healthy and restarts
them if they become unhealthy. We’ll refer to this process of restarting
goroutines as “healing” (much like Erlang's supervisors).

We’ll call the logic that monitors a goroutine’s health a "steward", and the
goroutine that it monitors a "ward". Stewards will also be responsible for
restarting a ward’s goroutine should it become unhealthy. To do so, it will
need a reference to a function that can start the goroutine.
